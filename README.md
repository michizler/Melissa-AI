# Melissa-AI
An AI assistant I call Melissa. Created with Python along with some built-in and downloaded libraries.

So to start off, the main library here, I'll say is the SpeechRecogintion Library. Some of the others include:

_random_

_pyttsx3_

_datetime_

_speech_recognition_

_wikipedia_

_smtplib_

_webbrowser as wb_

_os_

_psutil_

These Libraries allows for Melissa to carry out some lovely functions as you'll get to see when you read the code.
She can:

=> Send Emails

=> Search content on Wikipedia

=> Search the Web and open website

=> Play music

=> Shutdown your System

=> Logout from an Admin account in the system

=> Tell date and time.. etc

You two can as well play a game together if asked for. I incorprated my _Guess Me_ Repository game 
(https://github.com/michizler/Guess-Me) here.
Feel free to play around the code and email me more functionalities I can add.



Cheers.
